    <h3>
      The word pollution was derived from the Latin word pollution, which means
      to make dirty. Pollution is the process of making the environment pollute
      the water and the air by adding harmful substances. Pollution can take the
      form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as
      radioactivity, heat, sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of
      pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally
      occurring contaminants.Pollution causes an imbalance in the environment.
      This imbalance threatened the very survival of all forms of life. It's a
      threat to the whole world. India ranks at the bottom of 125 of the 132
      countries in the 2012 Environmental Performance Index. This report is
      produced by researchers at Yale and Columbia University in association
      with the World Economic Forum.

      Air pollution mostly occurs in industrial towns in India and abroad. While
      technological developments and industrialization have led to creation of
      wealth and prosperity, it has also caused a massive pollution of the
      environment.<b
        >The harmful burning of fuels such as coal and petroleum in some major
        industries like automobile, electrical power plants, etc., cause air
        pollution. Smoke emitted from factories and houses pollute the
        atmosphere. Excessive smoke and fumes have a very bad effect on plants,
        animals and human beings.</b

    <h1>Water Pullution :-</h1>

    <p style="word-spacing: 10px; line-height: 2">
      <b
        >Water Pollution refers to the presence of impurities and harmful
        elements in the water.</b
      >
      It is a source of many deadly diseases that cause harm, diseases, and even
      kill human civilization. The polluted water is not fit for drinking and is
      harmful to living beings such as animals, birds, and human beings.

    <h1>Land Pullution :-</h1>
    <img src="images/land.webp" height="500px" width="999px" />
    <p style="word-spacing: 10px; line-height: 2">
      <b
        >Land pollution refers to the deterioration of the earth’s land
        surfaces, at and below ground level. The cause is the accumulation of
        solid and liquid waste materials that contaminate groundwater and
        soil.</b
      >
      These waste materials are often referred to as municipal solid waste
      (MSW), which includes both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. When waste
      is deposited onto an area of land, the permeability of the soil formations
      below the waste can increase or reduce the risk of land pollution. The
      higher the permeability of the soil, the more likely that land pollution
      will occur. That’s why the Texas Disposal Systems Landfill, located just
      outside of Austin, Texas, was built in an ideal area. By utilizing the
      natural shale and clay in the land, the risk of land pollution has been
      significantly decreased.

      Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment
      that cause adverse change. Although environmental pollution can be caused
      by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that the
      contaminants have an anthropogenic source – that is, a source created by
      human activities. Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint
      source pollution. In 2015, pollution killed 9 million people worldwide.
